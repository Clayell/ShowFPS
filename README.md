Requirements
------------

KSP version 1.1 or later.


Installation
------------

Just copy into your KSP's GameData directory.

Features
--------

Simple movable framerate counter on your screen. For those that 
don't have access to the usual Windows utilities for display it, like Linux users.

Graph window to show FPS over time. Graph shows current FPS, a moving average of the FPS, and the Simulation rate (ie: how much is it lagging, related to yellow/red clocking). It can also show a line of a normal symrate (no lagging).
Along the left of the graph will be a scale for the FPS. Along the right will be a scale for the symrate.

Usage
-----

Just press F8 for toggle the FPS counter on and off. Clicking on the toolbar will show the Graph.

You can click and drag the counter anywhere you like. You can also change the default key F8 to anything you like in the settings.cfg file.
