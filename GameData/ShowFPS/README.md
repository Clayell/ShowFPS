v1.1, May 2016


Requirements
------------

KSP version 1.1 or later.


Installation
------------

Just copy into your KSP's GameData directory.

Features
--------

Simple framerate counter in the top right corner of the screen. For those that 
don't have access to the usual Windows utilities for display it, like Linux users.

Usage
-----

Just press F8 for toggle the FPS counter on and off. Pressing Ctrl+F8
while is enabled will also do a very minimalist benchmark, calculating the 
avegare FPS and the lowest count.

You can click and drag the counter anywhere you like. You might also change
the default key F8 to anything you like in the settings.cfg file.
